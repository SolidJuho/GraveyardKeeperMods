Mod created by SolidJuho.


Added resolutions in this mod:
* 1280x720
* 1366x768
* 2560x1440
* 3840x2160

Note: UI canvas is currently set to pixel ratio instead of screen ratio, which means UI won't scale.
Meaning on smaller resolutions you cant see UI. 
This is something I can't fix.

But on higher resolutions, you can see your health bar and "XP" points.

How to install:
1. Open your GK executable file folder and go \Graveyard Keeper_Data\Managed.
2. Rename old Assembly-CSharp.dll to Assembly-CSharpBACKUP.dll.
3. Place Assembly-CSharpRESOLUTIONmod.dll and rename it to Assembly-CSharp.dll.
4. Run the game and Create or load gamesave.
6. Open settings, First choose resolution and after that screenmode of windowed/fullscreen.


Resolution setting won't save, so you have to reset your resolution after each launch. This mod is temporary fix until official resolutions come out.

Uninstall:
1. Remove Assembly-CSharp.dll and remove word BACKUP from backupfile. 
This RAR also has backup file, incase you need it.
